ðŸ‘‹ Heya! Iâ€™m @stephanmantler and this is my repo, an eclectic collection of random stuff.

I am primarily a mountain guide these days but still like to tinker with code on my off days.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stepman), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/stepman) and [I have a home page too](https://stepman.is).
